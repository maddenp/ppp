Grammar rule names try to match those from the standards, with underscores in
place of hyphens.

Rule numbers or section numbers from the standard documents are given when
possible.

Rules appear in alphabetical order.

Some left-recursive rules given by the standard are translated to right-
recursive for PEG compatability; the original (implied) rules are given in
comments.

Rule names for literal terminals not defined in the standard are prefixed with
"t_".

Rules not defined by the standard are introduced where they appear to be useful
for parsing.

Ordered-choice order is different in many places from that given in the
standard, for correctness.

See standards documents for constraint information.

It would be nice to change 'label:label?' to just label, but Treetop does not
currently provide accessors for optional non-terminals (http://goo.gl/Usr9H).
Sounds like they'd accept a patch...

An entire hierarchy of complication under F90:R1002 is ignored, under the
assumption that it is only necessary to pass format specifications through
verbatim, not to analyze their contents. The grammar needs to be fleshed out
if/when this assumption breaks down.

The previous statment about passing format specifications through verbatim
notwithstanding: During normalization, F90:1016 H character format edit
descriptors are converted to string literals to preserve whitespace and case.
