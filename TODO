- Rule primary cannot tell the difference between function and array
  references. Since variable -> subobject -> ( array_section / array_element )
  precedes function_reference, the latter is recognized as the former. This
  needs to be fixed with environment analysis.

- Parser can't currently differentiate between some statement function
  statements and array-assignment statements. See the parse tree for t0229,
  for example: "i(f)=7" is identified as a stmt_function_stmt, while it is
  actually an array assignment. Needs to be fixed with environment analysis.

- Need tests of all R905 possibilities.

- Need tests of all R912 possibilities.

- Need tests of all R924 possibilities.

- Treat 'H' edit descriptor's suffix verbatim (e.g. '100 format (5Hhello)')?

- Wrap long lines
