- REMOVE sms_passthrough from grammar, etc.

- REMOVE sms$ignore and all the places it appears in the grammar.

- REMOVE sms_declarative from incorrct places after sms$ignore is gone.

- Need tests of F90:R1206 generic_spec (2nd two forms).

- Need tests of all R905 possibilities.

- Need tests of all F90:R912 possibilities.

- Need tests of all F90:R924 possibilities.

- In declare(), may need to pass in attr options (e.g. dimension, access)

- Move proc_sms_executable call from sms_executable : sms_barrier to
  executable_construct : sms_executable once sms$ignore begin/end are gone.

- In declare(), use push(tree) instead of insert(0,tree) to insert new
  declarations at the END of the declarations list. Unfortunately, the old
  ppp breaks (fim:cnuity.F90) with the declaration at the end -- can't see
  the break between declaration and execution.
